An updated version of https://github.com/jan146/playerctl-scroller . Now without the callbacks to the script file.

Configure the program through config.hpp .

See https://github.com/jan146/playerctl-scroller/blob/main/README.md for more details.

Note: This project doesn't actually have anything to do with suckless.org . I just renamed it that way because suckless also typically uses this source-based configuration philosophy.
